        <p>When a browser reads a web page, it generally reads from top to bottom. When it comes to a script, it will stop and execute the script before continuing to read the page.</p>
        <p>In the example below, the script is in the head section. The script tries to read a paragraph in the body section. However, the script is executed before the browser has read the paragraph, so the script cannot find the paragraph.</p>
        <p id="p1"></p>
        
        <p>However, the defer attribute specifies that the script should be executed later. This way the script can request information from the paragraph.</p>
